**Preface:**


1. All tracks collected are in 4/4 time. In all cases, 4 kick drum hits in the drop section correspond to 1 bar, with each kick drum hit corresponding to a quarter note.


2. Groove is NOT equivalent to rhythm pattern: Rhythm pattern discusses the distribution of long and short notes, while groove focuses on the overall wave-like feeling of a track (quantitatively, it can be referenced to the ADSR synthesis curve), mainly controlled by A (attack).


3. Distortion is NOT equivalent to "electronic": Clean is the opposite of distorted. Electronic timbres can also be clean (without much white noise or clipping). Electronic is opposite to acoustic, and electronic sounds might even be less distorted than acoustic ones. For example, a synthesized violin lacks the texture (mainly some nuance of white noise) of a real violin's bow on strings, resulting in less distortion.


4. House music classifications are not necessarily absolute or unique. Even Techno might refer to different styles in different contexts. Therefore, we aim to establish a self-consistent set of standards here.




**Progressive House** (*Martin Garrix, Manse, Tobu*):
Highly melodic, regular groove, main sound usually super saw/piano/strings or their combination.
[Criteria: Regular groove, strong main melody, quite often emotional or uplifting/euphoric]


**Future House**:
Irregular groove, less melodic than Prog House but still noticeable, overall tech/futuristic feel:
1. General Future House (*Mo Falk*): Chords might have electric piano/some synthesizers, main sound is synthesizer (square wave, etc.) or some unconventional but not too distorted timbres.
2. Future Bounce (*Brooks, Amel*): Extremely fragmented rhythm pattern, quite distorted main sound, very bouncy feel.
[Criteria: Fragmented rhythm, identifiable main melody, quite cool]


**Bass House** (*Julian Jordan, Blinders*):
No lead instrument or non-melodic lead instrument, chord progression almost indistinguishable, many distorted sounds/samples, very noisy (suitable for outdoor music festivals), some have a dark vibe.
[Criteria: Agitated, no main melody, often has aggressive dubstep samples like growling/stab after the first beat kick drum in each bar]


**Techno House** (*NUZB*):
Similar to Bass House but not as noisy, more suitable for dance halls and bars where the atmosphere is not as hyped.
[Criteria: No main melody, kick drum not as heavy (bouncier), many electronic sounds/samples]


**Deep House** (*Citadelle*):
Even quieter than Techno House, smooth groove, strong atmosphere, large reverb, mostly slower rhythm (around 120 bpm, while the above genres are mostly 126-128 bpm).
[Criteria: Deep, large reverb in mid-high frequency range, low end often uses Reese Bass]


**Bigroom** (*Hardwell, Dimitri Vegas & Like Mike, W&W*):
"Festival EDM", very hyped, many lead sounds resemble suona (Chinese double-reed horn).
[Criteria: Noisy, extremely short attack, extremely heavy kick drum with audible pitch, to the extent that a separate bass instrument is not needed]


**Future Rave** (*David Guetta*):
Relatively regular groove, bass with moderate attack and wave-like feel, many main sounds similar to electronically processed farting :) or some other quite electronic timbres.
[Criteria: Main sound timbre, overall wave-like feel]


**Slap House** (*R3HAB*):
Popular BGM of short videos, most have vocals, bass is very bouncy but not as fragmented as Future Bounce, often without chord instruments (bass provides some mid and high frequencies).
[Criteria: Bouncy feel and rhythm pattern of the bass, many are remixes of pop songs]
